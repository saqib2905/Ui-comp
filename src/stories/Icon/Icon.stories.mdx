# Icon

Icons symbolize common actions, features, and themes throughout our app.

Icons are powerful visual helpers and should be used with care. Overuse quickly results in user interfaces that are visually overwhelming or distracting.

Icons are commonly used:

- in primary navigation
- in page headers and section titles
- in alerts to bring attention to a specific theme (such as an announcement or an error)
- inline with text to add clarity
- to direct a userâ€™s attention to something they can take action on, or which results in an action

## Import

import { Icon } from '@tbe-ui/components';
